This is the final project for Comp Sci II.

Our objective is to create a game modeled after baking exercises and brain games often used as therapy with Alzheimer patients. Players are first prompted to choose a difficulty, this difficulty determines the amount of time they are given for each problem. Players are then given a list of recipes, all rated by stars, the stars are another layer of difficulty which determine the complexity of the recipe. 

After the player has chosen their difficulty and recipe, they are given a timed screen displaying each ingredient, the objective of this screen is for the player to memorize each ingredient as best they can in the allotted time. After allotted time, the player is presented with a selection screen, where they try to best match the ingredients of the recipe to the various images shown.
